  <refsect1 id='description'><title>DESCRIPTION</title>
  <para><emphasis remap='B'>health-checker</emphasis>
  checks if the system is coming up correctly during boot up.
  In case of an error, the remediation action depends on what happened before.
  If this is the first boot after a transactional update, an automatic rollback
  to the last known working snapshot is executed. If the snapshot was already
  rebooted successfully before, a reboot is tried. If this does not help,
  some sevices are shutdown and an admin has to repair the system.
  </para>
  <para>
    If the boot was successful, the current snapshot is marked as known to be
    working.
  </para>
  <para>Plugins are used for performing the tests and new plugins can be
  written. They are stored in the <filename>@PLUGINDIR@</filename>
  or /usr/local/libexec/health-checker (individual user plugins) directory
  and are executed either with the option <command>check</command> or
  <command>stop</command>.
  If called with "check", the plugin should verify that the service works and
  return 0, else 1. If one plugin returns "1", <command>health-check</command>
  will evaluate what to do. If neither a rollback or reboot is usefull, all
  plugins will be called with the "stop" option. In this case, the plugins
should shutdown the services are far as possible and usefull.
